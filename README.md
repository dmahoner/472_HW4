This repository holds code for a distillation streamlit app that calculate's the number of theoretical stages ina distillation column using the McCabe Thiele method. As well as plotting the equilibrium curve. 
This repository also has code to run a liquid-liquid extraction streamlit app that calculates the equilibrium compositions of two immiscible phases, as well as plotting the distribution curve.
Along with code to run a reactor streamlit app that will calculate the volume for a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor and a Plug Flow Reactor. As well as plotting the conversion profile for both reactors as a means to provide a visual comparison.
Finally, this repository contains python code for an OTR streamlit app that iteratively calculates dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration levels and plots the concentration over time.
